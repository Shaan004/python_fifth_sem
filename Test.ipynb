    "Q1.    Optimisation This is the process of finding the best solution or the most efficient way to solve a problem from a set of possible solutions. It involves finding the maximum or minimum value of a function, subject to certain constraints or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Types of Optimization are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "a.    Constrained Optimisation:Involves finding the best solution while adhering to a set of constraints, which can be equations or inequalities that the solution must satisfy.\n",
    "b.    Unconstrained Optimisation:\n",
    "Involves finding the best solution without any restrictions on the variables, meaning the solution space is not limited by constraints.\n",
    "c.    Linear Optimisation (Linear Programming):Involves an objective function and constraints that are linear, meaning both are represented by linear equations and inequalities.\n",
    "d.    Non-Linear Optimisation:Involves an objective function or constraints that are non-linear, making the problem more complex due to non-linear relationships.\n",
    "e.    Discrete Optimisation:Involves variables that can only take on discrete values, often integers, and is commonly applied in scenarios like scheduling and resource allocation."
